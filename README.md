A comprehensive Python implementation of the Siri Bhoovalaya decryption system, an ancient Indian cryptographic method. This project aims to create a robust, well-documented, and modular codebase that accurately replicates the complex decryption processes described in the original academic paper.

Core Features:

Implement a 27x27 matrix (Chakra) handling system with numbers 1-64
Create multiple traversal patterns (Bandhas) including Chakra-Bandh and Navamaank-Bandh
Develop a character substitution system for multiple Indian languages
Implement steganography features for hidden Prakrit and Sanskrit text extraction
